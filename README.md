Contains all Natural Language Processing(NLP) with Deep Learning labs done in ECEN 523. All done with _**PyTorch**_.
* **Lab 1** defines terms (such as _**corpus, document, sentence, word, stop words, punctuation, stemming, and lemmatization.**_) commonly found in NLP. Utilizes the _**Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK)**_. Also used X, formerly known as Twitter, to parse and count number of documents, sentences, words, stopwords, punctuations, special words, unique words, stems, and lemmas. Also includes few Statistics problems.
* **Lab 2** dives into and implements _**Byte Pair Encoding(BPE)**_, showcasing representation of word segmentation strategies. Uses _**Tokenizers**_. Starts with a base of contractions (I'm, you're, etc.) and expands them (I, am, you, are, etc.), then utilizes the BPE algorithm to expand the contractiosn in a sentence. Also dives into _**Regular Expressions**_, using **_beautifulsoup4_** to process HTML. Initial use of a chatbot from NLTK, providing answers to specific questions by parsing the HTML of a website. Also showcases implementation of a _**Spell Checker**_ for phones, and _**Weighted Minimum Edit Distance**_, utilizing delete, insertion, and substitution costs. <img width="789" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d677c6-44d0-4856-92ae-5eec2db2a406" />
